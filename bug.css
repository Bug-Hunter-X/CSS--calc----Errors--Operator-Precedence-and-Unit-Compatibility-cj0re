The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected behavior occurs due to operator precedence issues or missing spaces around operators. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` might not work as expected because of the missing space between `100%` and `-`.  Another common mistake is to use `calc()` with incompatible units, such as `width:calc(50%+10em)` which could cause errors depending on the browser.
